Preliminary Research

\section*{Week 1}
Learning goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Set up GitHub.
\item Learn how to use LaTeX.
\item Commence reading/research.
\end{itemize}


Reading list:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Montgomery Powering Ladder
\end{itemize}


Progress/Tasks completed:
\begin{itemize}
\item 26/09/13 Set up GitHub on my computer. Cloned the project repository and added additional resources to it. Learned how the GUI worked.
\item 26/09/13 Attempted to read The Montgomery Powering Ladder. Looked up what Abelian Groups and Lucas Chains are. Need to complete reading paper.
\item 26/09/13 Started a (rough) bibliography.
\item 26/09/13 Installed TexMaker and watched YouTube videos on tex document basics. Attempted to modify progress report, but couldn't view changes in the PDF, or create my own tex files. 
\end{itemize}


\newpage
\section*{Week 2}
Learning goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create bibliography on TexMaker. i.e. work out/learn how bib files work
\item Establish some cryptography basics to ensure better understanding of further reading.
\item Reattempt The Montgomery Powering Ladder paper.
\end{itemize}


Reading list:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Montgomery Powering Ladder.
\item Sections 19.7 McEliece, 19.8 Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems from Applied Cryptography.
\item The following sections of An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography: 1.1 Simple substitution ciphers, 1.2 Divisibility and greatest common divisors, 1.3 Modular arithmetic, 1.4 Prime numbers, unique factorization,
and finite fields, 1.7 Symmetric and asymmetric ciphers, 5.1 Elliptic curves and 5.2 Elliptic curves over finite fields.
\end{itemize}


Progress/Tasks completed:
\begin{itemize}
\item 30/09/10 Upon some web troubleshoot searches, discovered that installing MikTex and running TexMaker as admin solved the problem.
\item 02/10/13 Read sections 19.7 and 19.8 of Applied Cryptography. Didn't understand some of the notation in 19.7. The proceeding section was easy to understand, however I'm not familar with how the Diffie-Hellman, ElGamal, or Schnorr algorithms work. ElGamal will be looked into (I believe there is something related to it in 20.1). Will look further into "RSA" as well as I've come across that before.
\item 02/10/13 Read the abstracts and introductions of the three papers on Side-Channel attacks analysis.
\item 05/10/13 Simple substitution ciphers: Simple, as the title suggests. Nothing new or immensely enlightening but a nice way to start the book. 
\newline Divisibility and greatest common divisors: The Euclidean Algorithm was interesting. I was not familiar with it before unlike the other content of the section. I don't yet see how GCDs are directly relevant to Cryptography, but it was a fun read. Also, I learnt the concept of "relatively prime".
\newline Modular arithmetic: "\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z} is the ring of integers modulo m". I recognise this notation and now know what it means! I was introduced to Eulerâ€™s phi function and The fast powering algorithm in addition to that.
\newline Prime numbers, unique factorization,
and finite fields: The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic was something I used to simplify surds but did not know of formally. Came across a written definition of a field. Learnt that that hollow F is used to represent fields, along with a value. 
\item 06/10/13 With the aid of online resources, created LaTeX bibliography. 
\item 07/10/13 Symmetric and asymmetric ciphers:
\newline Elliptic curves:
\newline Elliptic curves over finite fields:
\item 07/10/13 Read The Montgomery Powering Ladder.
\end{itemize}
